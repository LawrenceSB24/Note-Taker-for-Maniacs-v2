# Note-Taker-for-Maniacs-v2

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is a re-hash of the previous note taker application. The application uses Express.js to modify and save notes.

## Important notes

Before we move any further, here are the list of changes from the previous version
> 1. There are no longer any route and fsUtil folders. All functionality is handled in the server.js file
> 2. fsUtil.js was removed as this was creating further issues with the apps functionality


Ok, now on to the show!
